  title: Number of unclustered models to analyse.
  short: Number of unclustered models to analyse.
  long: Top `X` unclestered models to analyse. Models are sorted based on
     their energetical score (if accessible) and only a subset defined
     by this variable are analysed. If no score available, a random set of
     `topX` models are analysed.
