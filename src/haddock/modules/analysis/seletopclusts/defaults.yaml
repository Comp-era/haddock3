  short: Number of best-ranked models to select per cluster. By default, 10 models are selected.
  long: Number of best-ranked models to select per cluster. By default, 10 models are selected. If one expects to find many clusters (e.g., in the case of vague restraints), this number can be reduced to speed up the protocol. Instead, if few clusters are expected (very specific and localized restraints) this number can be increased.

  title: Isolate haddock3 from internet.
  short: Completely isolate the haddock3 run & results from internet.
  long: For interactive plots, we are using the plotly library. It can be 
    embedded as a link to the plotly.js library and fetched from the web,
    or directly copied on the html files AT THE COST OF ~3Mb per file.
    Setting this parameter to `true` will add the javascript library in 
    generated files, therefore completely isolating haddock3 from any web call.
