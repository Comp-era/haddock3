  title: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
  short: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
  long: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of
    the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU
    and disk space.

  title: Receptor ChainID
  short: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations.
  long: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations. This determines which chain will be
    treated as the receptor for the L-RMSD and for I-L-RMSD.
