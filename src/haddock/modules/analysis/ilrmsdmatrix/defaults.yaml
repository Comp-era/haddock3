  title: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
  short: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
  long: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of
    the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU
    and disk space.
