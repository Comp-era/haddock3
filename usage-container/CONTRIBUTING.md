##  What I Love to See

We're not just building containers—we're crafting efficient, elegant tools for science. If you're looking for ways to make a difference, consider contributing to:

- **New functionalities** (e.g., new features or support)  
- **Reducing redundancy** in scripts or layered installs  
- **Shrinking image size** by stripping unused packages or optimizing layers  
- **Lowering computational/carbon footprint** through performance tweaks or ecoconscious configurations (smaller images)

##  Ideas Welcome — Let’s Connect!

Have a suggestion? Want to extend functionality, reduce image size, or make this container even more efficient and elegant? I'm all ears.

Feel free to:

- Start a discussion
- Or reach out directly (shantanukhatri.bio@gmail.com),  collaboration is always welcome.
