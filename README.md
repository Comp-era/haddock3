# WARNING: The `main` branch is not production-ready

The `main` branch is a prototype of newly refined architecture and it
does not yet contain the functionalities we have reported previously.
For a running version of HADDOCK3 please refer to the `alpha1` or the
release page. However, we won't develop `alpha1` further. Stay tuned for
new updates on the `main` branch as we are actively working on it.
Cheers!
