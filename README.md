## Introduction

HADDOCK stands for **H**igh **A**mbiguity **D**riven protein-protein **DOCK**ing, it is a widely used computational tool for modeling protein-protein interactions. Developed by researchers at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl) in the [BonvinLab](https://bonvinlab.org) it integrates various types of experimental data to guide the docking process, including biochemical, biophysical, and bioinformatics information.

## Installation

Please check the [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md) file for instructions.

You might also want to check the following utilities:

- [`haddock-restraints`](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-restraints): Tool to generate restraints to be used in `haddock3`.
- [`haddock-runner`](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-runner): Tool to run large scale `haddock3` simulations using multiple input molecules in different scenarios
- [`haddock-tools`](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools): Set of useful utility scripts developed over the years by the BonvinLab group members

## Usage

The most basic usage is;

```bash
haddock3 <configuration-file.toml>
```

Check the [EXAMPLES](examples/README.md) page for more some usage examples and the [MANUAL]() (_coming soon!_) for a more detailed explanation of the configuration file.

### Code Documentation

The code documentation is automatically built and hosted at [bonvinlab.org/haddock3](https://www.bonvinlab.org/haddock3/).

To build it locally (considering you have followed the installation instructions):

```bash
tox -e docs
```

> Warning messages are expected, but the documentation should be built successfully.

The rendered documentation will be available at `haddock3-docs/index.html`. This will open a local webpage with the
